Assets: class elements, specific, assigned to a class related to a resource. Assets are used in a class with students, an asset is linked to a resource (like an instance to its class in OOP). The code of the resource is used in the asset, but no modification of the resource is done in the class (except exceptional debug situations). Assets contain a finite set of information pertaining to the interaction of the asset with the student: (opening hours, access conditions, ..., teacher evaluations, etc). Those pieces of information are common to every asset, and, an HTML editor of these values is needed.

Les assets sont des instanciations des ressources.
