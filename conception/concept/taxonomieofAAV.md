## Taxonomie of Learning Oject TYpes

• Fundamental—For example, a JPEG of a hand playing a chord on a piano keyboard.
• Combined-closed—For example, a video of a hand playing an arpeggiated chord on a piano keyboard with accompanying audio.
• Combined-open—For example, a Web page dynamically combining the previ- ously mentioned JPEG and QuickTime file together with textual material “on the fly.”
• Generative-presentation—For example, a JAVA applet capable of graphically generating a set of staff, clef, and notes, which then positions them appropri- ately to present a chord identification problem to a student.
• Generative-instructional—For example, an EXECUTE instructional transac- tion shell (Merrill, 1999), which both instructs and provides practice for any type of procedure, for example, the process of chord root, quality, and inver- sion identification.

## Charactéristiques

• Number of elements combined—Describes the number of individual elements (such as video clips, images, etc.) combined in order to make the learning object.
• Type of elements contained—Describes the type of learning objects that may be combined to form a new learning object.
• Reusable component objects—Describes whether or not a learning object’s con- stituent objects may be individually accessed and reused in new learning contexts.
• Common function—Describes the manner in which the learning object type is generally used.
• Extra-object dependence—Describes whether the learning object needs informa- tion (such as location on the network) about learning objects other than itself.
• Type of logic contained in object—Describes the common function of algorithms and procedures within the learning object.
• Potential for inter-contextual reuse—Describes the number of different learning contexts in which the learning object might be used (that is, the object’s poten- tial for reuse in different content areas or domains).
• Potential for intra-contextual reuse—Describes the number of times the learning object might be reused within the same content area or domain.
