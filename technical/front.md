The frontend is principally based on Angular framework. It can be break down into 3 parts.

- Static html pages (Django templates).

- Dynamic html pages (Angular applications).

- Custom web components (Angular elements).

The choice of Angular for the frontend can be explained by the following points:

## Supported by Google.
One of the biggest advantage of Angular is that it is supported by Google. The best part about it is Google’s Long-Term Support (LTS). This sheds light on Google’s plan to stick with it and further scale up the Angular ecosystem. 

Great ecosystem of third-party components. The popularity of Angular has resulted in the appearance of thousands of additional tools and components that can be used in Angular apps. As a result, you can get additional functionality and productivity improvements.

## Component-based architecture.
In the second version, Angular shifted from an MVC to a component-based architecture. According to this architecture, an app is divided into independent logical and functional components. These components can easily be replaced and decoupled as well as reused in other parts of an app. In addition, component independence makes it easy to test a web app and ensure that every component works seamlessly.

## Angular Elements.
Starting with Angular 6, developers can easily add custom elements to any web app built with React, JQuery, Vue, or any other environment.

## Dependency injection.
is quite an arguable advantage of Angular. In plain English, dependency injection refers to one object supplying the dependencies of another object. These dependencies define how various components are connected and show how changes in one part of the code affects other parts. On the one hand, using dependency injection makes code more readable and maintainable. It can greatly reduce the time spent testing and hence cut the costs of web development. Starting from version 2, Angular provides developers with a separate tree of dependency injectors that can be changed or replaced without reconfiguring all components. But on the other hand, dependency injection may be time-consuming and it may be hard to create dependencies for components.

## Efficient Compilation With TypeScript.
TypeScript language, a superscript for JavaScript, ensures the creation of Angular applications. It offers high security as it supports types (primitives, interfaces, and more.). And, further helps catch and eliminate errors in the early phases while writing the codes or performing maintenance tasks. TypeScript allows two compilation modes: EcmaScript 3 (IE6 compatibility) and EcmaScript 5 (IE9 compatibility). Angular, thus, benefit from the rigor and flexibility of the TypeScript language. TypeScript offers improved navigation, autocompletion and refactoring services.

## Reusability.
The component-based structure of Angular makes the components highly reusable across the app. You can build the UI (User Interface) with moving parts, while also ensuring a smooth development process for developers.

## Simplified Unit-Testing.
Being independent of each other, the components make unit testing much easier.

## Improved Readability.
Consistency in coding makes reading the code a piece of cake for new developers on an ongoing project, which adds to their productivity.

## Ease of Maintenance.
Decoupled components are replaceable with better implementations. Simply put, it enables efficient code maintenance and update.
